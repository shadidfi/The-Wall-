        Assalamualaikum. We the Suhrawardians present to you a digital version of our Wallmagazine, a Website. To build this website, it consumed a huge amount of time. With the help of Cadet Shamit,who coded the whole website, Cadet Labib to type Bangla and Cadet Abrar,Cadet Rakin to type English, it was possible for us to built this. We want to show our gratitude to our respected House-Master sir and all the house tutors, who gave their tremendous effort and help to assist us in building this website. Not to mention, the spirit of all the Suhrawardians gave us the inspiration to move forward. During this period, we faced a lot of difficulties and technical errors. <br>
        
        For this reason, there maybe a lot of bugs and errors. So, we apologize.  <br>
        <br>
        <strong>NB:</strong>Requesting everyone to turn on their desktop mode from their phone(if surfing from phone).  Here only  HTML & CSS are used to design and develop this website. It may not be in perfect form if using from phone because javascript or any other languages were not added. But we tried our best to make it interactive. Thanks for surfing.</p>
