    <h1>Jester’s Privilege</h1>
    <h2>-Shaiham (3171)</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Visceral waves of intellect, <br>
            An ordinary find more or less.<br>
            The arrow of trout you dare deflect,<br>
            “The cap and bells”, an unswollen address. <br>
            <br>
            The sharpness of a tongue well bred,<br>
            It cuts you down you bleed regret. <br>
            Had you not handed me my marotte,<br>
            One could have enjoyed their upper hand.<br>
            <br>
            All in the name of amusement and jest,<br>
            Lottery of McCleary, a strange request.<br>
            You have nothing a scepter at best,<br>
            “Throw away your crown”, Just a jester’s behest. <br>
            <br>
            In exchange of an elicit of a rise,<br>
            Ignorance and dismissal is my prize.<br>
            A waste of prudence lice no other.<br>
            Along the lines of revenge, meet me at the edge,<br>
            A fool’s perfect use of jester’s privilege.<br>
