            <br> In 2014, a group of scientists from the university of Washington conducted an experiment on rats from learning more about what awaits a mammal population through subsequent stages of evolution. <br>
            <br>
            To start it all, ten rats were set at large in a large enclosed chamber with ample supply of food, water and all other biological elements required for survival. Basically, a utopia was constructed. Things were pretty normal at first. Rats started to thrive and grow healthy. Their co-existence was complementing their grit to survive. With the first year, the population growth continued exponentially. Everything seemed to go great. With no food crisis and reproduction becoming more steady, it seemed like these creatures were having the time of their lives. This continued up to 4th year.<br>
            <br>
            The start of the 5th year, even though more promising, was a bit different. It seemed that something was just off. Discords and quarrels seemed to flourish among these creatures. Their changing psyche became even more blatant with each passing day. Gradually nit seemed like groups were forming slowly among the race. Their mental shift from co-existence to enmity towards the other became more and more alarming. But it was not only grouping which made it so dangerously. Their evolving psychology seemed to know no bounds, because, it seemed like these little ‘innocent’ creatures were forgetting their own sex. At the end of the year was confirmed that the first signs of homosexuality were beginning to show. The yearly birth rate didn’t increase that year.<br>
            <br>
            The 6th year was even more interesting. Even after sufficient supply of food and water, a crisis commenced in the chamber. It seemed that a particular group of rats were starting to accumulate surplus food in their community. The tension of fulfilling the need of hunger became unbearable for the other groups. The concentration of power within the groups. The concentration of power within a group made it harder for the others to survive. And rats that tried to snatch or steal were subjected to what looked to be homicide in our society. These perpetrators were bitten mercilessly. Can we imagine? Rats biting, clawing, thrashing away at their own king. Examples of punishment were spreading across the populace, along with the hunger for food. This chain of control, which banded the food supply looked like nothing more than a worst-case scenario of dictatorship. Young rats started dying of hunger. And the meaning of term “survival of the fittest” started facing away their ethics and just when it started to seem unbearable, Their eyes fell on the dead corpses lying at random, suddenly something clicked within them. It’s needless to say that could fulfill their hunger. Even if it meant  eating through flesh of their own dead. It didn’t take long for then to turn to the living either. As the race for life and death  started, it became clear that it was every rat for himself. And this is how the rat population moved towards their annihilation with the addition of cannibalism to their traits. By the seventh year only 1200 rats remained and it was clear that doomsday was starting this race in the eye. Utopias can get shattered with the slightest change in plans. And by the eighth year , the population’s deceleration came to a halt at 0. Mammals, especially rats are just…. Nasty creatures. How a simple shift in living standards can absolutely demolish a populace.<br>
            <br>
            But there is also a lot more we must consider. Just when this interesting experiment seems to be harmless, you might start to remember that we humans are also mammals and this experiment  was modelled to represent the mammal class. And suddenly this harmless so-called model becomes so much more eerie and horrifying.<br>
            <br>
            I don’t believe I need to clarify that our race seems to be following the same destiny. See anything familiar? The signs are starting to show. Are we all also subject to the same conditions as these rodents? Instead of pondering the question, let’s just wait and witness what awaits us on the future...<br>
