            How would you like to be a bacteria for a whole day? You might be tempted to take up the offer if you are curious about the microscopic - subzatornic world which are too big to observe with our naked eyes. But you y might not be too happy to hear that a blink of an Tiny eyes for you is the span of the life a bacterium. And definitely, you would never want to live that short, Now the question is-Is our life also so observable and short timed for any magnanimou's entity?
            <br>
            <br>
            Suppouse you are observing a bacterium which lives for 10 seconds only. Now within these 10 seconds you observed all its birth, food habit, locomotion, reproduction, zind all its lifespan. So within a blank of your eyes, the entire life of an extremly tiny being is under your knowledge. Like that, if there is something which is billion times bigger than us, aren't our lifespan foo under its knowledge just like the tiny bacterium? For a clearer view consider your self as the Guelliver lost in liliputs realm. You are standing besides the railways and the liliputs realm is going by. Now you see, there is pit just within few kilometers where the train might fall. So, you see the pit, you can predict what can happen to the train but those liliputs inside the train don't know what's coming for them. Now you Mr. Gruelliver cari be liliputs hero if you inform them or â€¢fix the pit beforehand and gamble fate tate of their accident: Samely can be any vast entity which also knows about our future, can gamble it up just like Graelliver. Initially the counterpart that hits upon your mind might be the wideness of vision of Guelliver for which he can perdict the fate. But If we would rather think it an extension to dimensions possesed by the superior one, then can't we admit logical? Let's clarify.

            Albert Einestein has already brought the theory of Relativity which says, time, motion, everything is relative. Now we human beings are not parallel to time dimension. But time itself is relative to the observer. Your wrist watch won't like the same when you are standing on the moon. If you run fast as Usain Bolt time will fly slower to you, It's a simple time ditation theory. Now.lets consider dimensions for once. Our material world is composed of 3 dimensions; length, breadth and depth. To understand what I'm about to explain, let's dive back to the dimension. The O dimension, as it is, is simply a point. It lacks length, breadth and depth as a whole. An infinite array of such point would create a line which is the Ist dimension with only length, a single property. Again an infinite array of such lines would create 2nd dimension, za realm with the extra properties of breadth along along with the prior cone. These dimensions again stacked infinitely would produce our material dimension, the third t dimension, composed I of length, breath and height. Now what if we went further beyond this dimension? Imagine, multiple 23 dimensional planes stacked infinitely along another plane, time. The existence of other beings on other planets are a common topic of debate in our world, how about the existance of beings on other dimen sions? We, as 3-dimentional beings percieve things in 2 Dimensions (Many would say we see things in 3 dimensions, but all we see are overlapping of 2 dimensional images from cur ratinas, You can try touching the tips of your fingers from a distance with only one eye. Good luck with that, with no perception of depth). On the same path these probable beings on other dimensions would also percieve in one less. dimension from their actual dimension. For example, a person being on the two dimensional plane would not see a surface with on area. Is it so unlikely that being of a dimension magnitude of four could probably percive all the dimensions. down below? It may as well be that this higher dimensional being could see through time and space which exist only in inferior dimensions. We argue that there are no beings in the universe, or mul- fiverse other than is while scientific researches predict 10 dimensions ziccording to physics and 9 by mathematics. But its just za scientific prediction, we have yet to discover 2/3rd of the life in our own oceans. How can we say there isn't an entity vast that it could probably lock down on us.

            It we think deep, we will find the only 2 dimensional object in material world is the shadow. But it is not created on its own.Just as a shadow is created by a 3D being, could we be created by a higher being, God or alien?
