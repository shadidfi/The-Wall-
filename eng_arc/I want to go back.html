        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            In twilights first embrace, a child roams,<br>
            Lost midst the symphony of war's cruel tones.<br>
            Beneath the heavens, were chaos reigns supreme,<br>
            A soul adrift, In a realm were dreams were a fading gleam<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Within the dance of smoke and thunder's roar, <br>
            Innocence shivers, lost on this ravaged shore.<br>
            Eyes wide with wonder, now etched with fright,<br>
            Amidst the fractured Earth, A harrowing plight<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Torn tapestries of lifes serene embrace, <br>
            Shattered dreams linger, lost without trace <br>
            Child of peace, in turmoil's cruel descent, <br>
            Whispers in solitude, a heart's lament. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Each footfall echoes in a desolate land, <br>
            Where hope's fragile petals, by strife, are banned. <br>
            A spectar amidst armies locked in their strife, <br>
            A solitary figure, lost in the theature of life. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Yet amidst the tempest, a beacon flickers low, <br>
            A fragile ember amidst this haunting tableau. <br>
            A plea of solace in a world steeped in despair, <br>
            Seeking refuge from the anguished that's laid bare. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh, child of innocence, caught in wars cruel snare, <br>
            Your silence a requirem, sould laid bare. <br>
            In your tear-stained gaze, the world's cruel jet,<br>
            lost in the crossfire, a heart put to test. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            May peace, an elusive whisper, find its way, <br> 
            To cradle you gently in the breaking of day. <br>
            May tranquility weave its tender embrace, <br>
            And guide you from this desolate place. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            For you, a lament in this tragic braid, <br>
            A child lost amist the choices men have made. <br>
            In war's desolation, a haunting pled, <br>
            For peace to reign and set the innocent free. <br>
            <br>
