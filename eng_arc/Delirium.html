    <h1>Delirium</h1>
    <h2>-Rakin (3011)</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Thou ruined my being, <br>
                Thou art ruination.<br>
                Thou destroyed me, darling,<br>
                Thou art destruction.<br>
                Thou who shone, <br>
                Never yet always, like a sequin,<br>
                For debt of thine heart,<br>
                Mine thou sequestrated,<br>
                Now through my destruction and ruin,<br>
                Thou, not the others, shall be devastated. <br>
                <br>
                For thy mother and my father,<br>
                For my sister and thy brother,<br>
                For the illiterate and the innocents,<br>
                For the literate and the delinquents;<br>
                For everyone, all, me and thee<br>
                I will hex,<br>
                And slowly stop that heart of mine,<br>
                I will carefully burn,<br>
                And slowly stop this heart of thine. <br>
                <br>
                For those I talked of<br>
                And those I didn’t to be free,<br>
                For them all, you need fall,<br>
                For us, need fall we,<br>
                In that the abyss mightn’t do us apart,<br>
                In that even for a tick in life, we shan’t part;<br>
                While end of me not even ghostly I rue,<br>
                How the end of thee gives me a regret anew!<br>
                As it harshly tears at my cursed heart.<br>
                <br>
                Always was I rational-<br>
                But now, <br>
                Whilst most in thee see repulsion,<br>
                I in thee see beauty,<br>
                Whilst some in thee see danger,<br>
                I in thee see safety.<br>
                As such, now thou art my delusion-<br>
                Hence, I am to be your messenger,<br>
                Hence, I am to be your brevity<br>
                With rational intentions, making a rash decision.<br>
                <br>
                As I give this message,<br>
                Know that The Fates never play around,<br>
                And stench of poison and smell of love diffuse.<br>
                As I speak of the strings-<br>
                The pieces of strings laying about o the ground,<br>
                Words of love and death effuse.<br>
                All in pair for love is abound,<br>
                Abundant in its own right,<br>
                Enough for fearing the darkness without the others light.<br>
                And thus, though thou know now all,<br>
                Thou won’t refuse me,<br>
                For in this world and our own,<br>
                This is us, this is we.<br>
                As such, This loving poisonous kiss,<br>
                Shall set our heart and stomach ablaze,<br>
                And all is fine and all is amiss,<br>
                As eternal night starts, ends our days.<br>
                Myself for loved,<br>
                Thyself for unloved,<br>
                Unambiguously, with and without craze,<br>
                For this world shall rise, only whilst we raze.<br>
                </p>
