            <br>
            In the shadows of a waning moon,<br>
            A tale of love meets its untimely doom.<br> 
            A boy's heart, burdened with a heave weight<br>
            Fate and reasons sealed their bitter fate.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            A choice made from well hidden fears,<br>
            Drowning love, in a river of fallen tears.<br>
            Once entwined in laughters sweet embrace<br>
            In the silance of their favourite place<br>
            Now echoes linger in an empty space<br>
            Whispers of good bye, a tear stained face<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Their destiny unraveled at the seams<br>
            Yet She wore the fragrance of his sweetest dreams.<br>
            To break away or hold love's fragile strand,<br>
            He pondered, caught in indecision's quicksand.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Perhaps dreams collided with reality,<br>
            Love's essence lost in the harsh brutality.<br>
            A storm within, A tempest in his mind<br>
            Yearing for solitude, a silent plea;<br>
            Both of the hearts now, shattered & confined<br>
            Aching hearts, whispering a sad decree.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through the echoes of their fading song<br>
            A boy let go, the love dance went wrong<br>
            Reasons untold like shadows in the moonlit night<br>
            He walked away, suffused by the loanly light<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In the remains of what he used to be<br>
            A melancholy tale, a sad symphony.<br>
