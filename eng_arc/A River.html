            The sun has revealed it's crimson face. Far beyond Olive tre trees, smiles the sun. It's quiet desert baneath the sight to reddish sky. None con appreciate cate elhenal beauty but I enjoy such bark-The view with a through the see the mat mos deli he price of spending the whole night crouched with a light machine gun. Though I feel blessed not to feal the pain alone, my cresivning comes re all accompanying me. Omer Hani, my sufrench mate seed for an hour and kept an eye out for me to take a quick nap But how can I close my eyes knowing that we ne responsible for the fate of one of the inaliest location in the the world. If I continue to slerp, who will defend Jerusalern?

The fight appears to be over now.We have defeated the british once more ,but at a high cost. Mony have defented the Beilish ones more.Many lives have been lost and a lot more have been wounded. I take a stroll pround our positions to asses our men.Amidst all the cries of the wounded and the eternal silence of the dead, a soldier is motivating his comorodems. It seems after 700 years the crusades have again started, but did they ever really end?

November 30th, 1917, we were under British bombzadment day and night. We tred to gain some ground with counter attacks wisich failed Most of the men have perished. I'm alone in myd gout. I look at my side uture Ãœmer used to stay. Now. emply, reminding me of his bloody fore begging me to keep fighting. We are now only a handful of men sorrounded by the enemy.
<br>
<br>
Todays gorgeous night. We've just ended our prayers. As I gaze at the melancholic moon and dazzling stars, I feel something I haven't felt in a long time. A glimmer of hope? Perhaps the Lord has heard our petitions. I close my eyes, feeling pence in my heart and suddenly a tremendous boom slams into my years and a flesh of light blinds me. The cries of men and distant howling confirms the enemy is approaching. Within seconds, the sky lights up with explosions.
<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, I open fire on the adversary. Wave waves of the British fall prey to the hail of bullets but move come to fill their place. Amidst all the chaos. I hear some after polsteps.I quickly turn around and pull the trigger. A medlum height British soldier falls on the ground and groane for a bullet in his leg Seving no more of them coming it's evident that he somehow found in way around but disn't have luck or shouin I say enough courage? He nome close but didn't shoot. 1 come close to my wounded enemy to leke a good look and find something more of o boy than men. Somewhat filieen or sikken When I grip the rifle and sim the barrel to his head with a cold look, the shivering frightened eyes given look pleading for mercy. As I put my finger on the trigger, my heart whispers my mind, "What is a bou doing in a blood battle of men? Does he even know why he's fighting? What does he know about soil and power?" I look at his shaking hand holding the cross and some thought hit my mind. Aren't we all fighting for the same god who created and nourished us?We are the fighting for the truth but does truth always come with blood?If we are both fighting for god, then who shoud get God's support and which one is the truth?
<br>
<br>
I slowly lower my weapon and the fearfull eyes with a hope of mercy. Suddenly, a large flash and sound paused the time.I see a large crater near and lifeless body. I don't hear anything. Must be morlar shell I fell sharp ache and feel very weak.
<br>
<br>

I lie on the ground with a beating poin on my chest and feel calm. Bittersweet memonies from the past echoed through my mind. Amidst all the noises, I silently embrace solitude and listen to the whispering winds end dancing leaves of olive trees far away. Perhaps it's end. The holy city will be lost, so will be its harmony. I cost one last glance behind the hills towards sacred city. Under the shower of shelling and bullets, I slowly look inside the mystical depths of the velvet night and close my eyes. I put my hands together to that one supreme enntity seeking forgiveness. So he would still keep the gates of heaven for us after all the blood we have spilled in his name.
