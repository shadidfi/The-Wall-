            Embarking on journey to Hiroshima has forever been a cherished dream of mine. In the quiet town of Yamaguchi, which was just beneath the Historic Hiroshima prefecture, where days often unfolded in simple jous, something extraordinary hardly had ever happened. I was an average 11-year-old, balancing the rouline of school and play. When out of the blue, my par nts hit me with an unexpected announcement, we're heading to Hiroshimal What infuses an extra layer of warmth into this enchanting adventure is the delightful company of our esteemed neighbouring family, turning this journey into a heartwarming tapestry of shared laughter and cherished momenta.<br>
            <br>
            As per the agreed upon plan, our family and the formers' group were to convene of the local farmer's market at 6a.m., from where we would embark on our journey via a rented bus. The market was conver iently just a 5-minute walk from our house. Adhering to the typical Bangladeshi sence of time, w allowed for a plus-minus 10-minute buffer in our preplanned schedule: However, when we slightly behind our expected time, we were ready with apology in hand. Much arrived at 6.070m, to our surprise.our friends were already present, eagerly expressing apology for being too early! I admire the grociousness of our Japanese friends in their sincere apology.<br>
<br>
After wrapping up the necessary photo-taking formalities, our bus commenced its journey of appro ximately 6:15 am. The journey to Hiroshima was like flipping the first page of a book you've been dy ing to read. The hum of the engine, the passing landscapes of old known Yamaguchinit all felt like the prelude to an incredible chapter of my life. The scenie drive from Yamaguchi to Hiroshima spanned about these hours, allowing us to enjoy a leisurely breakfast and indulge in light snacks on board. Thankfully, our thoughtful Japanese friends had taken charge of all the provisions for in-transit meals, ensuring a delightful and well-prepared journey.

As we approached Hiroshima, the atmosphere inside the bus underwent a transformation.Conversations began to dim.giving way to a reflective quietude. The pealization of the historical significance of our desti malion hung in the air, and the collective mood became one of solemnity. Arriving the Hiroshima Prace Memorial Museum felt like a pilgrimage a journey not just through physical space but also at our initial destination, through The pages of history. The clock struck almost 9:38 when we finally crossed the threshold of Hiroshima Prace Memorial Museum. As we stepped into the dimly lit hall, my gaze was drawn to a corner where the a collection of personal belongings and everyday items quietly smoke of the devasting impact of the atomic bombing. Among them, a small charred school bag caught my eye.
<br>
<br>
Murasaki son, the youngest Japanese companion in our group. shared with me the poignant story behind the bag we discovered. It once belonged to Ayumi, a 12-year girl whose journey to school on that fatelul morning of August 6.1945, was tragically interrupted. As I gozed into the glass case. I couldn't help but witness the remnonis of a life abruptly cut short. Among the artefacts, a partially burnt textbook stood as a testament to Ayumi's cornest pursuit of knowledge, its pages still bearing her diligent notes. I found myself unable to resist imagining her perspective on that ill-fated morning, a once-promising day transformed into a catastrophic sence that forever altered the course of her young life. However, amidst the relies of devastation, what gripped my heart most intensely was a wristwatch, its hands forever frozen at 8:15. The frozen hands seemed to echo the frozen moments in time, forever suspended in the grim aftermath of the blast. It was a horrific representation of the exact moment the atomic bomb detonated leaving an indelible mark on history. The depiction of the atomic explosion and its imme diale aftermath was both chilling and heartbreaking which evoked za profound sence of sorrow and misery in my tender mind.

As we moved further, the gallery altered into the aftermath of the bombing, focusing on the recovery and efforts to rebuild the lives of the survivors, known as hibakusha. Their stories, cony- eyed through personal accounts and objects, served as an evidence to the strength of the human spiril in the face of unimaginable adversity. The combination of their words and visuals painted a touching picture of human strength amid the backdrop of devastation: Upon moving through the second gallery, we found ourselves in an outdoor space where o tall structure adorned with thousands of paper cranes stood at the centre. I ensily recognized the paper cranes, similar to the ones my origami class attempted to teach me, though my efforts were futile after countless attempts. Adjacent to this striking monument, o glass case showcased a particularly special crane-one crafted by a girl named Sadako Sasaki Murasaki-san shared that like me, she too was only 11 years old, though our lives unfolded in different eras. The narrative unfolded that felt ill with leukemin due to the atomic explosion and later succumbed to the disease. In her pursuit of a wish for peace, she precisely folded a the case was her very own creation. The thousand paper cranes. The crane preserved in when encountering Ayumi's school bag initially returned. A reminiscent fealing 1 experienced passion developed within feeling of com history me for all the children, much like myself, who endured the horrifying era of and made unimaginable sacrifices with their lives. I looked around and sow more cranes, not just from Sodoko.but from kids from all over the world. Each crane, carried a wish, wish for peace. It felt like the whole world had come together to make something beautiful out of something sad. IH made me realise that even though we were all different, we could shore something so special and important-o wish for peace.

After an emotionally charged visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, our group decided to conclude our journey with a visit to the picturesque Miyajima Island. As we approached the island via ferry, the serene waters and the iconic "floating "torii gate welcomed us to this captivating destination. Stepping off the terry, the first sight that caught smile and an my eyes wasn't the majestic torii gate, but rather a strikingly handsome man standing next to a traditional Japanese rickshaw. With a charming air of confidence, he looked if he belonged to the world of glamorous actors rather than the streets of Miyajima. Following this amusing encounter, our group explored the island, taking in the scenic beauty, wandering through the charming streets, and marvelling at the friendly deer that roamed freely. The traditional Japanese architecture, combined with the natural beauty of the island, created a tranquil atmosphere.<br>

<br>
As I bid farewell to Hiroshima. I couldn't help but feel a lump in my throat. The city had become a friend, a storyteller, and a peace of my own story. It's not just about the history or the laughs; it's about the way Hiroshima wraps us in its arms and whispers tales of resilience and hope. It gives us the memories and the beautiful reminder that, at the end of the day, we're all part of one big, diverse family called humanity. Arigato, Hiroshima! Untill our paths cross once more.
