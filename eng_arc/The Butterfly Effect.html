        <p>100-400 billion, is the approximate number of stars we have in our universe, or maybe millions upon millions in other galaxies; there are more starts in the universe than there are grains of sand on earth. And to think all of these was created from an explosion of something that was once smaller than atom is beyond our comprehension. This is the result of the Butterfly Effect.<br>
            <br>
            Let me elaborate, the Butterfly Effect describes how an insignificant change can cause a massive difference in the long run. In this case, the Big Bang created everything in existence, and it was smaller than an atom.  <br>
            <br>
            “Butterfly Effect” is part of a field of mathematics known as “chaos theory” which delves into how a small change can make a system behave entirely differently. It is also known as a “Chaotic System” which may come from how chaos stems from “uncertainty”. <br>
            <br>
            The name Butterfly Effect stems from a probability where a butterfly flapping its wings generates a tiny amount of force. And that may create enough force to cause a massive hurricane or tornado on the opposite side of the world. If it happened in the right place, in the right time and under the right circumstances. In other words, a complete coincidence. Things like these are impossible to predict, even by super computer standards. Throwing a ball at the same speed may not yield the same distance due to variations in vacuums, gravitational strength, air resistance or the direction you throw them.<br>
            <br>
            To conclude, uncertainty is among the scariest thing in the universe, no matter how you look. The state of not knowing what will happen next makes our life’s journey a difficult task. So, make this your best shot at life as you only get one.<br>
