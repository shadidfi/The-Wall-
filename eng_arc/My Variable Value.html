<br>Sirens waiting outside. I'm afraid. My hands are frembling. A voice said. "Open the doors. We have come for you."I'm frembling. They are banging on the doon I don't want to open the door. If I do. I won't be able to face the horrors. Why is the happening to me? Why am I here? Where did I go wrong. Maybe it all storled that day. The day lost my father.
<br>
<br>
From an early age, I was never fond of my folher, He was a cop. The cornmon people respected him. He was a great figure in the society But they say that brightest light hos the darkest shadow and that shadow became my nightmares. He wanted parfection. From spotless floors to perfect tidy bed, he wanted total perfection. If he didn't get the perfection he desired, he would punish me. Not punish, it was torture. When I became 17.1 was caught smoking by an old lady. She threatened to tell this to my father. A glimpse of past horrors flashed in front of me. I picked up my bat, hit her in the head. She was dead. I was afraid, very afraid. My father was in the charge of this case. Several days passed of him being away from me. No punishment. no torture. It was euphoric. But it didn't last long. He used to smoke inspite of having asthma which intrigued me. A suddenquirky thought knocked in my mind. And I went on a rampagesoaked in human blood to keep him away from me.
<br>
<br>
One day, asthma hit him just like I hoped it would. His breathing become faint. He asked for me. He asked for the inhaler in my hand. I didn't give it to him. I watched him suffer to death. A gleam of hope flickered in my eyes. Now, I can do whatever I want. Only the best days were waiting for me. But reality hit me harder. The greedy, corrupt co-workers of my father swallowed all of my father's savings with the money I was about to receive. Due to not being able to pay my college fees, they threw me out. No degrees, certificates or job.I was just a loser wondering here and there. And at the end of the linz, a poster saved me from my demise. A job offer to work as a dome' in morgue 1 dialed a number.got an address and was hired.
<br>
<br>
The cold haunting smell and zaura of morgue sent shivers down my spine. It was no less than a graveyard with numerous bodies which haven't been put to rest. It was like I could hear the agonizing cries of the dead. Everyday to my life was filled with tremor. panic and the misery of the ones I killed. They were driving me insane Days passed, weeks passed and so did months. But nothing changed | The spookiness become etched in my mind and heart. I wanted to leave everything and run away. But I had to survive. I will survive. I won'l run.
<br>
<br>
Today someone came in the morgue. A tall guy with fair skin and a pair of murky hazel eyes. Something about him was off. Maybe it was his eyes which felt cold, heartless and emotionless. When he looked in my eyes, an impulse pan through me.It is is if a thousand needles are piercing my skin. Fear engulfed me. I ran out of breath I blacked out for a second. I gripped the desk to save myself from the fall. He was still there standing completely still. Why is he here? "I've come to receive the body of Fredric Arthur." he said in a grumpy voice. I searched the records and escorted the guy to the body. I unlocked the freezer and just as I was about to touch the hondle of the freezer, o whispering voice said, "Please don't open it. "I looked around but could not see anyone Anyone! Except that guy. I pulled it open and I was dumbstruck. How is this possible? The guy in the freezer is exactly the same as the guy behind me. I didn't have the courage to look back. But my curiosity took over. I glanced back and no one was there. Fredric was not there anymore. It was changed to my first victim. She grab my neck and said, "You can't run any more. We have come to you." I somehow manag ed to loosen her grip on my neck and then I pan. I ran from there towards the exit but I couldn't escape. The door closed. Something pulled me back and then I probably lost my consciousness.
<br>
<br>
In my dream I could see the 17 years old me with the blood stained cricket bat in the middle and a lot of me of post and future circling around him. All poin ting towards towards that me in the middle. Their voices echoed, "You made me a murderer. "I woke up and found myself painting. As I looked up I could see my fins! victim. She looked exactly the same with the same injury in her forehead. In low voice she was rapidly chanting the word 'murderer while leaking down. She titled hear head and glanced towards me. With a smirk on her face she said, You murdered us! You thought we would let you live?" I won and mon through the corridors and locked myself in the bathroom. I cried. I cried looking helplessh and fragile just like a baby I blocked the door am very scared and afraid I don't want Survive this? to die. I that no one con break through.I want to live. Will I be able to survive this? 
<br>
<br>
The sirens are still waiting our side. The voices are getting louder. I'm still in the dilemma if I will be able to survive this or not. Will I be forgiven?"Are you there? Open the door! We have come to arrest you!" "Will I be able to face my past? Suddenly the banging stops. Total silence. I don't want to open the door. But my hands are the hands of a murderer. They have tremendous courage. They open the door slowly only to increase my burden. I am not ready for this sight. The trauma is kicking in. Why am I seeing this? My father hanging by the neck infront of my eyes. He said in a joyfull voice, "Come on son! Let's go to hell together. "I ran away from there and locked myself in the laboratory. For a moment I thought my eyes were lying. I was crying and laughing at the same time at my luck. Someone please help me! Have I gone mad. "Nobody can help you now. You have bought your own demise. "the lady said. I backed and threw things at her screaming, "I want to live. Get away. Let me live!" She gave an eerie smile and disappeared. Suddenly, I noticed, the things I threw were chemicals. Being mixed together they created poisonous gases. I accidently inhaled it a lot. It was getting harder to breath. I tried to open the door but it won't budge. The lock has failed. While pleading for help I saw him again. This time, he's standing infront of me. I am running out of breath. I asked him, my father for help. "I won't. I won't help you or leave you. I will always haunt you." said my father. The glimpse of hope flickering was lost hearing those words. Its getting harder and harder for me to breath. I just wanted to live happily. Does an ordinary person like me not have the right to wish this. Now as I closed my eyes asked from life?" and I am asking the world one last question. "Was it loo much I asked from life?
