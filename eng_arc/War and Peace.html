            Leo Tolstoy’s ‘War and peace’ is definitely one of the most famous, yet most daunting, books in the modern library. The principal cause for its fearsome standing is because the book is well over a thousand pages. Still - despite being so strenuous- it has remained a masterpiece and is loved by most who read it. <br>
            <br>
‘War and Peace’ is an epic novel that is still pertaining to the current reader because its like an encyclopedia of the life of Russians in the 19th century. It’s a book that fantastically relays the beauty of merely being alive through its moving scenes, realistic character development, and above all, through the ordinariness of the characters. Expressing the extraordinariness of everyday living more broadly.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the story are two male antipodes, Count Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. While prince Bolkonsky acts as a model Russian soldier, son, husband and a skillful owner, Pierre Bezukhov is like a dreamer who aims the highest, but fails in achieving it. Completely unlike each other at first glance, they still have something in common- both of them are searching for their real selves and happiness.<br>
<br>
The author subtly worked out the characters we encounter while reading and their roles in the overall picture of the novel. Being so long, Tolstoy has room for unparalleled character development. Some characters go from being favorites to being loathed, to ultimately becoming beloved again.<br>
<br>
The book is not about war, not about peace, it is though, about people. We live through the pages in ups and downs. We see characters in joy and grief, in social gatherings, and in the trenches of patriotic war.<br>

‘It’ll make you feel better about being alive’<br>
                                                                           -Andrew Kaufman<br><br>
Something About the book touched my soul. It is a book that I think everyone ought to power through, because its not just a book, but an experience.<br>
