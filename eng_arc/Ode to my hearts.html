    <h1>Ode to my hearts</h1>
    <h2>-Mosfiq (2981)</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Thou pleaded to be my muse<br>
            Oh my sweetheart!<br>
            Thou pleaded to not be her’s<br>
            Oh my heart!<br>
            I declined most my values<br>
            And accepted both thy requests. <br>
            <br>
            While my heart<br>
            Thou are mine,<br>
            Utterly confused, I ask<br>
            Am I thine?<br>
            <br>
            And my heart?<br>
            Must I remain a mystery to thee?<br>
            Or maybe, from within I hear murmurs<br>
            Have I lost thee?<br>
            Without my or thy knowledge,<br>
            While in me beats her’s,<br>
            And thou, in privilege<br>
            Resonate inside her, harmonious with her’s?<br>
            <br>
            Must I remain such to myself, my hearts?<br>
            Writing hymns and odes<br>
            In both thy names,<br>
            Still for me and still for thee?<br>
            <br>
            Oh my hearts! Oh my muses!<br>
            Have I lost the ability<br>
            To differentiate thee apart?<br>
            Can I really not,<br>
            Accept both thy request?<br>
            <br>
            Oh but now I know,<br>
            All I need do, is let go-<br>
            Let go of all the beautiful emotions,<br>
            And embrace all my values,<br>
            And that way, accept both thy requests.<br>
            </p>
