    <h1>No More Dreams</h1>
    <h2> -Saad (3118)</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Know, I don’t bear grief anymore, <br>
No longer merge myself in endless tears.<br>
Now, the smile on my face shines brightly,<br>
Wiping away the tears hidden in the depth of my eyes. <br>
<br>
Now, I don’t spend nights anymore,<br>
Staring at that distant sky.<br>
Do not weave intricate dreams,<br>
Among the busy stars anymore.<br>
<br>
Now, I don’t want to hear anymore,<br>
Those meaningless words chasing after me.<br>
There are no more tears left in my eyes,<br>
And no more smiles on my face.<br>
<br>
Now, I don’t want to stay in wait for someone,<br>
Throwing pebbles at the river of fate.<br>
I don’t want to hear you breathe,<br>
Late in the nights as before.<br>
<br>
Know, I don’t want these false dreams anymore,<br>
Do not want to tell stories under the moonlit sky,<br>
Do not want to get caught amidst the mesmerizing sights,<br>
Do not want to get washed away in the tide of illusions,<br>
Now, I am not the same I was before.<br>
