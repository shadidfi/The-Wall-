    <div class="story">
    <p>
        Whoever can, let him do it, but not me <br>
        Here’s the bloody crown, man’s highest power.<br>
        Let me leave;<br>
        Albeit with a shadow of failure.<br>
        <br>
        Human civilization- let me go, I have seen enough<br>
        In the name of civilization.<br>
        No more, let me go.<br>
        
        Happiness, for which so much madness and greed<br>
        Pour fourth,<br>
        No- no more, let me go.<br>
        
        I can’t bear the helpless suicide of whales,<br>
        Evils of starving children,<br>
        Hungry bodies aging quickly,<br>
        Thin stretching hands of the Third world,<br>
        Let me go.<br>
        <br>
        Right this instant,<br>
        Let me go.<br>
        <br>
        Terrible agony, wasteful suffering,<br>
        Fear and weeping from refugee camps, torture,<br>
        Goodbye war, mass murder,<br>
        Goodbye, goodbye.<br>
        <br>
        No more shiny weapons,<br>
        Atom bombs, neutron bombs and other nonsense,<br>
        No more sinister plots for human destruction.<br>
        Whoever can, let him do it, but not me.<br>
        I hate it all.<br>
        Satisfied even a shadow of failure,<br>
        Let me leave.<br>
         
    </p>
